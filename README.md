# Bot Army
This project is based on **Web Automation**. This is started with an idea to make a bot that can **attend online classes**. But now this has more than that, a **Bot Army** that will do everything for you.

<!--
### Problems you may face

- Problem 1. `'chromedriver.exe' executable needs to be in PATH.`

// First install webdriver-manager

`pip install webdriver-manager`

// Then import ChromeDriverManager

`from selenium import webdriver`

`from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager`

// This will automatically update the driver

// No need to specify the path in this case

`driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())`

...

- Problem 2. `selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate element:`

// This is a race condition where the 'find element' is executing before it is present on the page

// The line below will wait for 1 second and then continue the code

`time.sleep(1)`
